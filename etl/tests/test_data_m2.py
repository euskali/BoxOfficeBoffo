"""M2 accept criteria, run against the real built tables.

PR CI has no data, so these skip there. The data-build job in deploy.yml sets
BOFFO_REQUIRE_DATA=1, which turns a missing table into a failure.

Accept: every weekend from 1982W01 through the latest completed weekend
exists, or is listed in the checks.py gap report as having no capture in
either archive. Carry-over films (e.g. late-2016 releases) have continuous
total_gross.
