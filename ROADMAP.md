# BoxOfficeBoffo — Roadmap

**What it is:** a free, non-commercial hobby site that brings back what old Box Office Mojo did well, plus one feature it never had:
**"time machine" rankings** — pick any film and any date and see exactly where it stood on every cumulative list *at that moment*
(domestic, inflation-adjusted, admissions), plus career totals and rankings for directors and actors as of that date.

Inspired by the Blank Check with Griffin & David crowd who miss the old Mojo charts.

**Ground rules**
- Hobby, no revenue, public repo. Only sources whose terms allow a public site: archives, Wikidata (CC0), and public-domain BLS data. The IMDb datasets are out because their terms forbid republishing them as a database. See `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` and `DATA_NOTICE.md`.
- Static site: there's no server to pay for or maintain. Data ships as Parquet files and is queried in the browser with DuckDB-WASM.
- Data is fetched and built in GitHub Actions, never committed, and published only with the site.
- Every number carries its source and quality flag (actual / estimate / rental / baseline).

## Phase 0 — Foundations ✅ (this commit)
- Repo, roadmap, MVP plan, data source inventory, CLAUDE.md for Claude Code.

## Phase 1 — MVP: Domestic time machine, 1982 → present
Detailed task list: `docs/MVP_PLAN.md`.
- Weekend-chart snapshots 1982–2016 from an existing scraped dataset (Purdue stat695data, MIT).
- 2017 → present weekend charts from archived Box Office Mojo pages only (Wayback Machine first, Common Crawl as fallback). Box Office Mojo is never fetched live.
- Pre-1982 baseline: hand-curated lifetime grosses for the biggest older films, so all-time lists as of 1985 still include Star Wars, Jaws, etc.
- Film identity via Wikidata (legacy Mojo IDs P1237, IMDb IDs P345), with re-releases grouped under one title.
- Credits from Wikidata (CC0) → director and actor rollups.
- Three measures: nominal $, CPI-adjusted $, and estimated admissions (ticket-price-adjusted, old-Mojo style).
- Static site: film page with a rank-over-time chart and a date picker, an all-time leaderboard as of any date, person pages, and a weekend chart for any weekend.
- Look and feel: late-90s movie fan site (old GameFAQs / eeggs / Movie Mistakes era) built with Tailwind v4. Dense tables, navy header bars, Verdana, square corners, but fast, responsive and accessible. See `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- Built and deployed to GitHub Pages by GitHub Actions.

## Phase 2 — Keep it current
- Weekly scheduled run of the deploy workflow (Monday) picks up the latest archived weekend, rebuilds Parquet, and redeploys.
- Data-quality dashboard: unmatched titles, gaps in weekends, totals that went backward.
- Manual override files reviewed through PRs.

## Phase 3 — Deep history (pre-1982)
- Transcribe Variety / Boxoffice annual "all-time champs" and year-end lists from the Media History Digital Library (Lantern), Boxoffice back issues on the Internet Archive, and Variety anniversary issues.
- Clearly separate **rentals** from **grosses**, with a toggle and an explainer.
- Re-release history for the classics (Gone with the Wind, Snow White, Star Wars SE, E.T. 1985/2002) so their totals step up on the right dates.
- Variety National Boxoffice Survey #1s (pre-1982) as "weekly #1" history.

## Phase 4 — Worldwide and finer grain
- Lifetime worldwide totals (TMDB if its terms allow a public site; cross-checked) as a separate, clearly approximate list.
- International timelines where data exists (mostly 2000s+).
- Daily granularity for the modern era (opening day, fastest to $X records as of a date).

## Phase 5 — Fun stuff
- "Showdowns": overlay any films' cumulative curves, by days in release or by calendar date.
- Milestone history: who held #1 all-time, and when it changed hands (a "succession of champions" timeline).
- Studio, franchise and genre rollups as of a date.
- Box Office Game–style quiz mode, e.g. "guess the top 5 all-time on July 4, 1993".
- Shareable permalinks for any view (film + date + measure).

## Non-goals (for now)
- Ads, accounts, paywalls.
- Republishing other sites' charts wholesale. We publish *derived* rankings and credit sources.
- Real-time daily estimates.
