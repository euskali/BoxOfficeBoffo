# BoxOfficeBozo

**Box office history, as it happened.**

A free hobby site that brings back the old Box Office Mojo charts, plus a "time machine": pick any film and any date to see where it ranked on the all-time lists *at that moment*. It covers nominal dollars, inflation-adjusted dollars, and estimated tickets sold, with career totals for directors and actors as of any date.

Looks like 1999. Works like 2026.
